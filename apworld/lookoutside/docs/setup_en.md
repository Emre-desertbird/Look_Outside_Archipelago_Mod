# Look Outside development playtest setup

This APWorld is for local development on Survivor Mode (Normal difficulty) only. Explorer Mode and Cursed Mode
sessions are rejected.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED REGISTRY SUMMARY -->
Registry **74** provides **273 checks**: 167 equipment copies, 103 physical items and 3 access unlocks.
All checks have access rules across **74 regions and 81 entrances**,
with **36 quest-resolution groups**.
The solver also uses **19 generation-only calendar events**, outside the item pool.
<!-- END GENERATED REGISTRY SUMMARY -->

New seeds use `chronological_access_v1`: generation-only day/action events
reserve the audited timed progression paths. Rose must be logically available
by Day5 and Phone by Day10. Native days and quest choices remain player
controlled. Earlier real endings still win; ending release recovers player-caused
misses and is not used to justify inherently late placements. Regenerate seeds
to apply these rules; registry74's plugin and save format remain compatible.

Permanent unlocks include Elevator Access, Planetarium Door Access and Power
Restored. Starting electricity and the native
outage remain; an early Power Restored item restores electricity immediately
after the outage, with a message confirming both events. The fuse box remains
an independent AP check. Joel's peaceful and hostile resolutions award both
Door Knob and Toothy Whip checks; Pierre's mail choices award the same check.
Any real ending on any day completes the AP goal; cheat-mode Credits do not count.
Quest dates, new-day waits, and dialogue cutoffs stay vanilla. At Day15, the
generic home-door ending can finish a run with unfinished quests. The client
reports completion and requests release of every remaining check; an offline
ending is saved and reported on reconnect. The host must allow release with
`release_mode: auto`, `goal`, `enabled`, or `auto-enabled`. A disabled-release
room requires host intervention, which is shown in the Archipelago window.
The entire Gauntlet stays vanilla. Use the project
README to stage a separate game copy. The Steam installation is read only for
this project. Start the staged game with `LOA_DEV_MODE=1` to expose the
development **Archipelago** menu command. Its window accepts a server address,
slot name, and optional masked password, and shows status, the server log,
received items, missing locations and deadlines. An optional overlay shows recent
log lines on the map. Passwords are not saved. Combat preparation remains up
to the player. Quest resolution includes permanent
Hellen/Dan refusals, Sybil's peaceful Telescope outcome, and Bright Frederic.
The Radio and Medic-in-a-jar are useful AP items. Their eight-hour and real-new-day
recharge cycles remain vanilla, and delivery works before meeting their givers.

Use the matching plugin/APWorld pair from the development package and follow
its README to prepare replacements for a separate test game. No game assets
are distributed. Start a fresh seed/save after a registry change and connect
before collecting randomized pickups. First connection is rejected after a
randomized reward, an audited quest resolution or a day rollover. Existing
vanilla saves without reliable start metadata cannot be converted to AP.

AP saves require matching registry and game build metadata. Save schema 7 rejects
older AP schemas rather than migrating them: use their original mod/game versions
to finish those runs, or start a fresh save. A rejected load leaves the save file
untouched and shows an error. Already-received queued items can deliver offline
after a compatible reload when inventory space becomes available.

Automated native probes, live exchange, and all-location sphere tests pass.
A full interactive playthrough, including adverse multiplayer timing, remains
the release gate. See the package playtest guide.
